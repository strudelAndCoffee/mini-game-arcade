# Mini Game Arcade

The initial stage of this project is to hold all of the games that I have been building as practice in game development. Most, if not all of these games are coded in JavaScript, so they can be played on your web browser.

This repository is a work in progress, but I plan to deploy it once I have built enough games and am happy with the UX!
