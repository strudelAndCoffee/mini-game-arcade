# Mini Game Arcade

The initial stage of this project is to hold all of the games that I have been building as practice in game development. Most, if not all of these games are coded in JavaScript, and can be played on your web browser.

This repository is a work in progress, but I plan to deploy it to GitHub pages once I have built enough games and am happy with their UX!

## Code Source Cited

I am not the original author of the code for the games of Pong, Snake, Dino Game Clone, Wordle Clone, Tic Tac Toe, or War.

All original code for these games are openly available for use, copy, and reference by [Web Dev Simplified](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified), and all files and images are freely offered as per the tutorial videos on the Web Dev Simplified [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified) channel.

The code for Hangman was based on a tutorial for a TypeScript/React version of the game by Web Dev Simplified, and borrows snippets from the Wordle Clone repository. You can find my version the tutorial code [here](https://github.com/strudelAndCoffee/react-ts-guess-the-word).
