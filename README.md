# Mini Game Arcade

The initial stage of this project is to hold all of the games that I have been building as practice in game development. Most, if not all of these games are simple mini-games coded in JavaScript and TypeScript, and can be played on your web browser.

This repository is a work in progress, but I plan to deploy it to GitHub pages once I have built enough games and am happy with their UX!

## Code Source Cited

I do not own the code for Pong, Snake, Chrome Dino Game Clone, and Wordle Clone, nor any .json file or .png images used to recreate these games.

All original code for these games are openly available for use, copy, and reference by [Web Dev Simplified](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified), and all files are freely offered as per the tutorial videos on the Web Dev Simplified [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified) channel.

The code for Hangman was based on a tutorial for a TypeScript/React version of the game by Web Dev Simplified, and borrows snippets from the Wordle Clone repository.
